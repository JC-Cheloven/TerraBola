# TerraBola
Program to simulate the curvature of the horizon, and more.

The program plots the line of the horizon as you would see it if 
earth were a perfect sphere of radius 6371km.
The altitude of the observer is of course adjustable.
The view includes "an object", represented by a rectangle whose
altitude, dimensions and distance to the observer are also adjustable. 
The image can be zoomed for better visualization, specially when the
object is far away.
Both supporters and haters of flat earth theories will for sure
enjoy this program :-)
